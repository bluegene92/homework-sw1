          Hi, I'm Dat, a graduate student diving deep into the world of computer
          science with a focus on software development. My academic journey is
          fueled by a passion for innovation and problem-solving. When I'm not
          immersed in code, you can find me hitting the pavement, exploring the
          world one run at a time. I also find solace and joy in the melodies of
          the piano, where I lose myself in the beauty of music. As I continue
          to navigate the exciting intersection of technology and creativity, I
          strive to make a positive impact through my work and pursuits.
